## Methods

The BrAPI Project Coordinator is responsible for the day-to-day operations and general maintenance of the project infrastructure, as well as coordinating updates to the standard. They organize community events and encourage collaboration between community groups. Long term planning and organization is handled by the BrAPI Advisory board. This is a board of six community members who are elected by the community to represent their interest in the project.

The standard documentation is stored and maintained in a public [GitHub repository]( https://github.com/plantbreeding/BrAPI). The core documentation is written using the OpenAPI 3 documentation standard. The core documentation is automatically published on Apiary and SwaggerHub, two API documentation hosting sites. The specification has a standard MIT open source license.

New versions of the BrAPI standard are developed based on community demand. Opportunities to enhance and improve the standard are identified by the community, tracked in GitHub issues, and implemented to create a new stable version. This process ensures the standard stays relevant, updated, and stable over time. Minor version updates are designed to be backwards compatible.

Hackathon events are the primary approach used by the BrAPI community to foster collaboration and further development. One in-person and one virtual event per year maintain project momentum and social comradery. The hackathons provide a dedicated time to discuss improvements and issues with the specification, particular use cases, and project stewardship.
