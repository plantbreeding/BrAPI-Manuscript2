### General Infrastructure 

Adopting BrAPI compatibility into an existing system can be difficult sometimes. The BrAPI Community has developed several tools to make adoption easier. This includes things like pre built code libraries, connectors to other technology standards, and mappers to alternate data types or data files. THe goal here is always to lower the barrier to entry for the BrAPI community, making it easier for other groups to get started and connect their existing data to the standard.
