#### ImageBreed

Unoccupied aerial and ground vehicles (UAVs and UGVs) enable the high throughput collection of images and other sensor data in the field, but the rapid processing and management of these datasets are often a bottleneck for breeding programs seeking to deploy these technologies for time-sensitive decision making.
[ImageBreed](https://imagebreed.org/) [@doi:10.1002/ppj2.20004] is an open-source, BrAPI-compliant image processing tool that supports the routine use of UAVs and UGVs in breeding programs through standardized pipelines.
It creates orthophotomosaics, applies filters, assigns plot polygons, and extracts ontology-based phenotypes from raw UAV-collected images.
The BrAPI standard is used to push these phenotypes back to a central BrAPI-compliant breeding database where they can be analyzed with other experiment data.
The ImageBreed team has collaborated with others in the community to enhance the BrAPI image data standards, which it uses to upload raw images to a central breeding database, or any other BrAPI-compatible long term storage service.
