#### PHIS 

<!-- Isabelle -->
[PHIS](http://www.phis.inrae.fr/) [@doi:10.1111/nph.15385], the Hybrid Phenotyping Information System, is an ontology-driven information system based on semantic web technologies and the [OpenSILEX](https://github.com/OpenSILEX/) framework. 
PHIS is deployed in several field and greenhouse platforms of the French national [PHENOME](https://www.phenome-emphasis.fr/) and European [EMPHASIS](https://emphasis.plant-phenotyping.eu/) infrastructures. 
It manages and collects data from basic phenotyping and high-throughput phenotyping experiments on a daily basis. 
PHIS unambiguously identifies the objects and traits in an experiment and establishes their types and relationships via ontologies and semantics.

Since its inception, PHIS has been designed to be BrAPI compliant, encompassing the Core, Phenotyping, and Germplasm BrAPI modules. 
This enables integration with other BrAPI-compliant systems and platforms, simplifying the exchange of accession and phenotyping data across systems. PHIS is actively integrated with the genebank accessions management system [OLGA](https://crb-plantes-olga.fr/public/frontend/auth/login), and is indexed by the [FAIDARE](https://urgi.versailles.inrae.fr/faidare/) data portal [@https://urgi.versailles.inrae.fr/faidare].
BrAPI-enabled interoperability promotes a more coherent and efficient approach to the management and use of phenotyping data on various platforms and research initiatives within the European scientific community.
BrAPI compliance also ensures that PHIS is compatible with other standards such as the Minimal Information About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment ([MIAPPE](https://www.miappe.org/) [@doi:10.1111/nph.16544]).
By integrating BrAPI requirements into its structure, PHIS not only meets the standards of the phenotyping field, but also strengthens its capacity for interoperability and effective collaboration in the wider context of plant breeding and related fields.
