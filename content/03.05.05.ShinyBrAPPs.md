#### ShinyBrAPPs

The [ShinyBrAPPs](https://github.com/IntegratedBreedingPlatform/ShinyBrAPPs/) code repository contains a number of useful tools, built using the[R-Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) framework and the [BrAPI R](https://github.com/mverouden/brapir-v2) open source library. The R-Shiny framework allows user communities to quickly prototype and produce applications that are finely tailored to their needs, thus improving adoption and daily use of data management systems. An international collaboration of developers from CIRAD and the IBP have been working together as part of the [IAVAO](https://www.iavao.org/) breeders community to develop these ShinyBrAPPs, in support of national breeding programs in western Africa. These applications are typically connected to BMS and/or Gigwa and provide tools for specific use cases. BrAPI compliance offers these systems the opportunity to add functionalities in a modular way through the development of external plugin applications that can quickly fulfill specific needs for this group of breeders and scientists.

So far, four applications have been developed covering the fields of trial data quality control, single trial statistical analysis, breeding decision support, and raw genotyping data visual inspection. The "BMS trial data explorer" retrieves data from a single multi-location trial and displays data counts and summary box-plot for all variables measured in different studies. It also provides an interactive distribution plot to easily select observations that require curation and a report of candidate issues that needs to be addressed by the breeder. The "STABrAPP" tool is an application for single trial mixed model analysis. It basically provides a GUI to the [StatGen-STA](https://biometris.github.io/statgenSTA/) R package. The "DSBrAPP" tool is a decision support tool helping breeders to select germplasm according to their various characteristics and save this germplasm list into BMS. Finally, the "[snpclust](https://github.com/jframi/snpclust)" tool enables a user to check and manually correct the clustering of fluorescence based SNP genotyping data.
