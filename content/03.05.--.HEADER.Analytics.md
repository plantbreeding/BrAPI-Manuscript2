### Analytics

Modern breeding programs have multiple decision points requiring analysis and integration of various data types. While there are numerous Breeding and Genetics Data Management systems (above), certain program tasks could be simplified by development of specific streamlined analysis systems to enable certain tasks by utilizing data from different sources to make efficient data-driven decisions. With increased computational power at their disposal, scientists can construct more advanced analysis pipelines by combining various data sources.

The tools developed by the BrAPI community can pull in data from multiple BrAPI compatible data sources and provide enhanced analytical functionality. In many cases, there is no longer a need to import and export large data files to a local computational environment just to run standard analytical models. These tools are able to extract the data they need from various data sources without much human intervention or human error and then enabling user interaction to support decision support.
