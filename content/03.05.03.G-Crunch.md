#### G-Crunch

G-Crunch is an upcoming user-facing analysis tool that attempts to fill the space of simple, user driven analytics requests, with a generic user interface and the ability to swap out data sources and analysis tools. G-Crunch hopes to streamline repeatable, debuggable simple analytic requests and results.
G-Crunch, as a tool, couldn't feasibly exist without BrAPI. The support of BrAPI interfaces allows G-Crunch to use one unified request method, and adapt to the user's (BrAPI-compliant) existing network of tools, which lowers the barrier to entry for adoption.
