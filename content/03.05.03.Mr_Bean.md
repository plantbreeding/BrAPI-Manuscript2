#### Mr.Bean

<!-- Johan -->
[Mr.Bean](https://apariciojohan.github.io/MrBeanApp/) [@doi:10.3389/fpls.2023.1290078] is a graphical user interface (GUI) designed to assist breeders, statisticians, and individuals involved in plant breeding programs with the analysis of field trials. By utilizing innovative methodologies such as SpATS for modeling spatial trends, and autocorrelation models to address spatial variability. Mr.Bean proves highly practical and powerful in facilitating faster and more effective decision-making. Modeling Genotype-by-environment interaction poses its challenges, but Mr.Bean offers the capability to explore various variance-covariance matrices, including Factor Analytic, compound symmetry, and heterogeneous variances. This aids in the assessment of genotype performance across diverse environments.

Mr.Bean boasts flexibility in importing different file types, yet for users managing their data within data management systems (DMS), the process of downloading from their DMS and importing it into Mr.Bean can be cumbersome. To address this issue, QBMS was integrated into the back-end. This feature prompts users to input the URL of a BrAPI compatible server, enter their credentials (if necessary), and select the specific trial they wish to analyze. Subsequently, users can seamlessly access their dataset through BrAPI and utilize it across the entire Mr.Bean interface.
