In the global system for ex situ conservation of plant genetic resources (PGR) [@doi:10.3390/plants10081557], a total of ~5.8 million accessions are conserved in 1750 ex situ genebanks [@doi:10.2135/cropsci2017.01.0014]. Unique and permanent identifiers in the form of DOIs are available for more than 1.7 million accessions [@{https://glis.fao.org/glis/}]. Each DOI is linked to some basic descriptive data that facilitates the use of these resources. Many DOIs are also linked to additional data from different domains or will be in the future. However, a data space beyond the most basic information is needed that includes genotypic and phenotypic data. This space will help answer questions on the global biological diversity of a plant species, on duplicate detection, on provenance tracking for the identification of genetic integrity, on the selection of the most suitable material for various purposes, and to support further applications in data mining or AI. In this context, the aim of the AGENT project (<https://www.agent-project.eu/>), funded by the European Commission, is to develop a concept for the digital exploitation and activation of this PGR data space, [@doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.18] and to test it in practice using two important crops, barley and wheat. In two work packages, standards and technology for data interoperability will be developed to establish a genetic resources infrastructure, which regulates data acquisition of genotypic and phenotypic data, integrates and archives them and makes them accessible according to FAIR principles. To this end, 13 European genebanks and 5 bioinformatics centers are cooperating and have agreed on standards and protocols for the data flow and data formats [@doi:10.12688/f1000research.109080.2] for central archiving of genotypic and phenotypic data.

The BrAPI specification is one of the agreed standards. The implemented BrAPI interface enables AGENT to mine current and historic genotypic and phenotypic information. This will drive the discovery of genes, traits, and knowledge for future missions. It will also complement existing information for wheat and barley to foster an improved management of PGR data for other crop species across European genebanks. The AGENT database backend aggregates curated passport data, phenotypic data, and genotypic data about wheat and barley accessions of 18 project partners. This data is integrated via BrAPI endpoints (<https://github.com/AGENTproject/BrAPI>) and explorable in a web portal (<https://agent.ipk-gatersleben.de>). Genotyping data uses the DivBrowse [@doi:10.1093/gigascience/giad025] storage engine and its BrAPI interface. API endpoints for sample data are implemented using the AGENT database SQL to BrAPI broker service.

To integrate those BrAPI endpoint provider into a single service and URL scheme, we work on their integration in a BrAPI proxy service. As next steps, we will expand BrAPI implementation to enable the integration of analysis pipelines in the AGENT portal, e.g. for genebank mining tools such as the FIGS+ pipeline developed by AGENT partner ICARDA [@doi:10.22004/AG.ECON.266624]. Another perspective is to integrate the data collected in the AGENT project into the European Search Catalogue for Plant Genetic Resources (EURISCO) [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkac852] and to implement BrAPI endpoints to make data on PGR collections in European genebanks programmatically accessible.
