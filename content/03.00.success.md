## Success Stories

<!-- success stories highlighting BrAPI usefulness in breeding cycle. Perhaps reference the original BrAPI paper where possible use cases were proposed.  -->

Below are a number of short success stories from the BrAPI community. These tools, applications, and infrastructure projects serve as another indicator of community growth and success over the past 5-10 years. These stories clearly illustrate all the different ways the BrAPI Standard can be used productively and in practice.

###Success story activates data stock in European ex situ genebanks of plant genetic resources

In the global system for ex situ conservation of plant genetic resources (PGR) [1], a total of ~5.8 million accessions are conserved in 1750 ex situ genebanks [2]. Unique and permanent identifiers in the form of DOIs are available for more than 1.7 million accessions [3]. Each DOI is linked to some basic descriptive data that facilitates the use of these resources. Many DOIs are also linked to additional data from different domains or will be in the future. In order to answer questions on the global biological diversity of a plant species, on duplicate detection, on provenance tracking for the identification of genetic integrity, on the selection of the most suitable material for various purposes, including breeding and research, and to support further applications in data mining or AI, a data space beyond the most basic information is needed that includes genotypic and phenotypic data. In this context, the aim of the AGENT project (https://www.agent-project.eu/) funded by the European Commission is to develop a concept for the digital exploitation and activation of this GenRes data space via European ex situ genebanks according to the FAIR criteria [4] and to test it in practice using two important crops, barley and wheat. In two work packages, standards and technology for data interoperability will be developed to establish a genetic resources infrastructure, which regulates data acquisition of genotypic and phenotypic data, integrates and archives them and makes them accessible according to FAIR principles. To this end, 13 European genebanks and 5 bioinformatics centers are cooperating and have agreed on standards and protocols for (i) the data flow (see figure {@fig:AGENT_Genotyping_Data_Flow}) and data formats [5] for central archiving of genotypic and phenotypic data.

For this purpose, the AGENT database is being developed, in which the passport data, phenotypic and genotypic data about wheat and barley accessions of 18 project partners are harmonized and integrated via BrAPI endpoints (https://github.com/AGENTproject/BrAPI) and visualized in a web portal (https://agent.ipk-gatersleben.de). The BrAPI endpoints were made available by scattered implementation. Genotyping data use DivBrowse [6] storage engine and BrAPI interface. Endpoints for sample data are implemented using AGENT database SQL to BrAPI broker service.
To integrate those BrAPI endpoint provider into a single service and URL scheme, we work on their integration in a BrAPI proxy service.  As next steps, we will expand BrAPI implementation to enable the integration of analysis pipelines in the AGENT portal, e.g. for genebank mining tools such as the FIGS+ pipeline developed by AGENT partner ICARDA [7]. Another perspective is to integrate the data collected in the AGENT project into the European Search Catalogue for Plant Genetic Resources (EURISCO) [8] and to implement BrAPI endpoints to make data on PGR collections in European genebanks programmatically accessible.
