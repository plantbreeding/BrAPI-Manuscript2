Being able to access and share this data in standard formats is essential. The adoption of a common informatics platform for crops that may have limited resources brings economies of scale, allowing common informatics components to be used across multiple species. The close integration of such a platform with commonly used breeding software, visualization, and analysis tools reduces the barrier for entry to researchers and provides a common framework to facilitate collaborations and data sharing. This work presents significant updates to the Germinate platform and highlights its value in distributing prebreeding data for 14 crops as part of the project ‘Adapting Agriculture to Climate Change: Collecting, Protecting and Preparing Crop Wild Relatives’ (hereafter Crop Trust Crop Wild Relatives project) led by the Crop Trust (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"https://www.cwrdiversity.org\">https://www.cwrdiversity.org</jats:ext-link>). The addition of data on these species compliments data already publicly available in Germinate. We present a suite of updated Germinate features using examples from these crop species and their wild relatives. The use of Germinate within the Crop Trust Crop Wild Relatives project demonstrates the usefulness of the system and the benefits a shared informatics platform provides. These data resources provide a foundation on which breeding and research communities can develop additional online resources for their crops, harness new data as it becomes available, and benefit collectively from future developments of the Germinate platform.</jats:p>",

To facilitate routine analyses and to drive breeding decisions, data integration is critical for effective management of germplasm, field experiment design, phenotyping, tissue sampling, genotyping, aerial‐phenotyping campaigns, image files, and geo‐spatial information. To this end, ImageBreed provides a software solution for end‐to‐end image‐based phenotyping integrated into the Breedbase plant breeding system. ImageBreed provides open‐source orthophotomosaic construction for raw image captures from standard color cameras and from the MicaSense RedEdge multispectral camera. Additionally, previously assembled orthophotomosaic raster images can be uploaded. Orthophotomosaic images allow for streamlined extraction of plot‐polygon images; however, ImageBreed plot‐polygon images can also be extracted directly from raw aerial image captures. A web–database interface streamlines assignment of plot‐polygon images from the orthophotomosaic or raw aerial‐captures to the field experiment design. Image processes spanning Fourier‐transform filtering, thresholding, and vegetation index masking are applied to reduce noise in extracted phenotypes. Summary‐statistic phenotypic values are extracted for every observed plot‐polygon image using a structured ontology. Plot‐polygon images are queryable against genotypic, phenotypic, and experimental design information for training of machine learning models and for driving breeding decisions in varietal advancement. ImageBreed is publicly available at <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"http://imagebreed.org\">http://imagebreed.org</jats:ext-link> and built on the open‐source Breedbase system (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"https://github.com/solgenomics/sgn\">https://github.com/solgenomics/sgn</jats:ext-link>); all image‐processing scripts are available at <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"https://github.com/solgenomics/DroneImageScripts\">https://github.com/solgenomics/DroneImageScripts</jats:ext-link> and via a Docker image.

The magnitude of drift can be mitigated by maximising the effective population size, as is the goal of genetic management strategies. Different mating systems, specifically those leading to reproductive skew, exacerbate genetic drift by distorting contributions. In the absence of an active management strategy, reproductive skew will have long-term effects on the genetic composition of a population, particularly where admixture is present. Here we examine the contrasting effects of conservation management strategies in two ex situ populations of the Critically Endangered eastern black rhino <jats:italic>(Diceros bicornis michaeli)</jats:italic>, one managed as a semi-wild population in South Africa (SAx), and one managed under a mean-kinship breeding strategy in European zoos. We use molecular data to reconstruct pedigrees for both populations and validate the method using the zoo studbook. Using the reconstructed pedigree and studbook we show there is male sex-specific skew in both populations. However, the zoo’s mean-kinship breeding strategy effectively reduces reproductive skew in comparison to a semi-wild population with little genetic management. We also show that strong male reproductive skew in SAx has resulted in extensive admixture, which may require a re-evaluation of the population’s original intended role in the black rhino meta-population. With a high potential for admixture in many ex situ populations of endangered species, molecular and pedigree data remain vital tools for populations needing to balance drift and selection.</jats:p>",

A diverse set of stakeholders—representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers—have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.</jats:p>",

Instead, a species is better represented by a pangenome or collection of genomes. Unfortunately, managing and using pangenomes for genomically diverse species is computationally and practically challenging. We developed a trellis graph representation anchored to the reference genome that represents most pangenomes well and can be used to impute complete genomes from low density sequence or variant data.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>The Practical Haplotype Graph (PHG) is a pangenome pipeline, database (PostGRES &amp; SQLite), data model (Java, Kotlin or R) and Breeding API (BrAPI) web service. The PHG has already been able to accurately represent diversity in four major crops including maize, one of the most genomically diverse species, with up to 1000-fold data compression. Using simulated data, we show that, at even 0.1× coverage, with appropriate reads and sequence alignment, imputation results in extremely accurate haplotype reconstruction.

VCF is usually stored in a compressed manner and can be indexed for fast data retrieval of variants from a range of positions on the reference genome. The format was developed for the 1000 Genomes Project, and has also been adopted by other projects such as UK10K, dbSNP and the NHLBI Exome Project. VCFtools is a software suite that implements various utilities for processing VCF files, including validation, merging, comparing and also provides a general Perl API.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Availability:  http://vcftools.sourceforge.net</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Contact:  rd@sanger.ac.uk</jats:p>",

BrAPI is a standardized web service API specification. The development of BrAPI is a collaborative, community-based initiative involving a growing global community of over a hundred participants representing several dozen institutions and companies. Development of such a standard is recognized as critical to a number of important large breeding system initiatives as a foundational technology. The focus of the first version of the API is on providing services for connecting systems and retrieving basic breeding data including germplasm, study, observation, and marker data. A number of BrAPI-enabled applications, termed BrAPPs, have been written, that take advantage of the emerging support of BrAPI by many databases.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>More information on BrAPI, including links to the specification, test suites, BrAPPs, and sample implementations is available at https://brapi.org/.

This necessitates access to efficient management systems to keep track of cross, performance, pedigree, geographical and image-based data, as well as genotyping data. In this article, we report the progress on the Breeding Information Management System (BIMS), a free, secure and online breeding management system that allows breeders to store, manage, archive and analyze their private breeding data. BIMS is the first publicly available database system that enables individual breeders to integrate their private phenotypic and genotypic data with public data and, at the same time, have complete control of their own breeding data along with access to tools such as data import/export, data analysis and data archiving. The integration of breeding data with publicly available genomic and genetic data enhances genetic understanding of important traits and maximizes the marker-assisted breeding utility for breeders and allied scientists. BIMS incorporates the use of the Android App Field Book, open-source phenotype data collection software for phones and tablets that allows breeders to replace hard copy field books, thus alleviating the possibility of transcription errors while providing faster access to the collected data. BIMS comes with training materials and support for individual or small group training and is currently implemented in the Genome Database for Rosaceae, CottonGEN, the Citrus Genome Database, the Pulse Crop Database, and the Genome Database for Vaccinium.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Database URLs: (https://www.rosaceae.org/), (https://www.cottongen.org/), (https://www.citrusgenomedb.org/), (https://www.pulsedb.org/) and (https://www.vaccinium.org/)</jats:p>",

This data-driven approach hinges on strong foundations in data management, quality control, and analytics. Of crucial importance is a central database able to (1) track breeding materials, (2) store experimental evaluations, (3) record phenotypic measurements using consistent ontologies, (4) store genotypic information, and (5) implement algorithms for analysis, prediction, and selection decisions. Because of the complexity of the breeding process, breeding databases also tend to be complex, difficult, and expensive to implement and maintain. Here, we present a breeding database system, Breedbase (https://breedbase.org/, last accessed 4/18/2022). Originally initiated as Cassavabase (https://cassavabase.org/, last accessed 4/18/2022) with the NextGen Cassava project (https://www.nextgencassava.org/, last accessed 4/18/2022), and later developed into a crop-agnostic system, it is presently used by dozens of different crops and projects. The system is web based and is available as open source software. It is available on GitHub (https://github.com/solgenomics/, last accessed 4/18/2022) and packaged in a Docker image for deployment (https://hub.docker.com/u/breedbase, last accessed 4/18/2022). The Breedbase system enables breeding programs to better manage and leverage their data for decision making within a fully integrated digital ecosystem.</jats:p>",

Here we attempted to estimate the effects of ∼50,000 marker haplotypes simultaneously from a limited number of phenotypic records. A genome of 1000 cM was simulated with a marker spacing of 1 cM. The markers surrounding every 1-cM region were combined into marker haplotypes. Due to finite population size (Ne = 100), the marker haplotypes were in linkage disequilibrium with the QTL located between the markers. Using least squares, all haplotype effects could not be estimated simultaneously. When only the biggest effects were included, they were overestimated and the accuracy of predicting genetic values of the offspring of the recorded animals was only 0.32. Best linear unbiased prediction of haplotype effects assumed equal variances associated to each 1-cM chromosomal segment, which yielded an accuracy of 0.73, although this assumption was far from true. Bayesian methods that assumed a prior distribution of the variance associated with each chromosome segment increased this accuracy to 0.85, even when the prior was not correct. It was concluded that selection on genetic values predicted from markers could substantially increase the rate of genetic gain in animals and plants, especially if combined with reproductive techniques to shorten the generation interval.</jats:p>",

The capability to integrate DivBrowse into existing web applications supports interoperability between different web applications. Built-in interactive computation of principal component analysis allows users to perform ad hoc analysis of the population structure based on specific genetic elements such as genes and exons. Data interoperability is supported by the ability to export genomic diversity data in VCF and General Feature Format 3 files.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>DivBrowse offers a novel approach for interactive visualization and analysis of genomic diversity data and optionally also gene annotation data by including features like interactive calculation of variant frequencies and principal component analysis.

In total, it provides data on more than two million accessions, making an important contribution to unlocking the vast genetic diversity that lies deposited in &amp;gt;400 germplasm collections in 43 countries. EURISCO serves as the reference system for the Plant Genetic Resources Strategy for Europe and represents a significant approach for documenting and making available the world’s agrobiological diversity. EURISCO is well established as a resource in this field and forms the basis for a wide range of research projects. In this paper, we present current developments of EURISCO, which is accessible at http://eurisco.ecpgr.org.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Scientific research plays a key role in the advancement of human knowledge and pursuit of solutions to important societal challenges. Typically, research occurs within specific institutions where data are generated and subsequently analyzed. Although collaborative science bringing together multiple institutions is now common, in such collaborations the analytical processing of the data is often performed by individual researchers within the team, with only limited internal oversight and critical analysis of the workflow prior to publication. Here, we show how hackathons can be a means of enhancing collaborative science by enabling peer review before results of analyses are published by cross-validating the design of studies or underlying data sets and by driving reproducibility of scientific analyses. Traditionally, in data analysis processes, data generators and bioinformaticians are divided and do not collaborate on analyzing the data. Hackathons are a good strategy to build bridges over the traditional divide and are potentially a great agile extension to the more structured collaborations between multiple investigators and institutions.</jats:p>",

The ITC also serves as a vital safety backup and transit centre for national banana genebanks and ensures that germplasm is clean of pests and diseases and freely available under the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. In more than 35 years of activity, the ITC has distributed over 18,000 banana accession samples to researchers and farmers in 113 countries. Ex situ conservation of vegetatively-propagated crops such as banana poses very particular challenges. Maintaining the ITC genebank is labor intense and costly. Efficiencies are sought through research and development of techniques on detecting viruses, the genetic integrity of accessions, and on innovative means of safeguarding banana diversity, such as conserving populations of wild species by seed banking. Although the conservation of global banana diversity is the main objective of the ITC, significant value comes from its holistic approach to better understand and promote its germplasm through numerous research activities and resources. Techniques for morphological and molecular characterization serve to identify and describe the collection, while also determining what gaps should be filled by collecting missions with national partners. The evaluation of desirable agronomic traits inherent in <jats:italic>Musa</jats:italic> spp. are investigated by a high-throughput phenotyping platform, which helps breeding programs to select cultivars resistant or tolerant to biotic and abiotic stresses. Genomic and bioinformatic studies of several banana wild relatives greatly enhance our understanding of <jats:italic>Musa</jats:italic> genetic diversity, links to important phenotypic traits and bring new methods for management of the collection. Collectively, these research activities produce enormous amounts of data that require curation and dissemination to the public. The two information systems at the ITC, <jats:italic>Musa</jats:italic> Genebank Management System and the <jats:italic>Musa</jats:italic> Germplasm Information System, serve to manage the genebank activities and to make public germplasm-related data for over 30 banana collections worldwide, respectively. By implementing the 10-year workplan set out in the Global Strategy for the Conservation and Use of <jats:italic>Musa</jats:italic> Genetic Resources, the network MusaNet supports <jats:italic>Musa</jats:italic> researchers and stakeholders, including the ITC, and most importantly, links to the world’s banana-producing countries via three regional banana networks.</jats:p>",

The flexibility of the VCF format specification facilitates its use as a generic interchange format across domains but can lead to inconsistency between files in the presentation of metadata. To enable fully autonomous machine actionable data flow, generic elements need to be further specified.</ns3:p><ns3:p> We strongly support the merits of the FAIR principles and see the need to facilitate them also through technical implementation specifications. They form a basis for the proposed VCF extensions here. We have learned from the existing application of VCF that the definition of relevant metadata using controlled standards, vocabulary and the consistent use of cross-references via resolvable identifiers (machine-readable) are particularly necessary and propose their encoding.</ns3:p><ns3:p> VCF is an established standard for the exchange and publication of genotyping data. Other data formats are also used to capture variant data (for example, the HapMap and the gVCF formats), but none currently have the reach of VCF. For the sake of simplicity, we will only discuss VCF and our recommendations for its use, but these recommendations could also be applied to gVCF. However, the part of the VCF standard relating to metadata (as opposed to the actual variant calls) defines a syntactic format but no vocabulary, unique identifier or recommended content. In practice, often only sparse descriptive metadata is included. When descriptive metadata is provided, proprietary metadata fields are frequently added that have not been agreed upon within the community which may limit long-term and comprehensive interoperability. To address this, we propose recommendations for supplying and encoding metadata, focusing on use cases from plant sciences. We expect there to be overlap, but also divergence, with the needs of other domains.</ns3:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Modern breeding programs routinely use genome-wide information for selecting individuals to advance. The large volumes of genotypic information required present a challenge for data storage and query efficiency. Major use cases require genotyping data to be linked with trait phenotyping data. In contrast to phenotyping data that are often stored in relational database schemas, next-generation genotyping data are traditionally stored in non-relational storage systems due to their extremely large scope. This study presents a novel data model implemented in Breedbase (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://breedbase.org/\" xlink:type=\"simple\">https://breedbase.org/</jats:ext-link>) for uniting relational phenotyping data and non-relational genotyping data within the open-source PostgreSQL database engine. Breedbase is an open-source, web-database designed to manage all of a breeder’s informatics needs: management of field experiments, phenotypic and genotypic data collection and storage, and statistical analyses. The genotyping data is stored in a PostgreSQL data-type known as binary JavaScript Object Notation (JSONb), where the JSON structures closely follow the Variant Call Format (VCF) data model. The Breedbase genotyping data model can handle different ploidy levels, structural variants, and any genotype encoded in VCF. JSONb is both compressed and indexed, resulting in a space and time efficient system. Furthermore, file caching maximizes data retrieval performance. Integration of all breeding data within the Chado database schema retains referential integrity that may be lost when genotyping and phenotyping data are stored in separate systems. Benchmarking demonstrates that the system is fast enough for computation of a genomic relationship matrix (GRM) and genome wide association study (GWAS) for datasets involving 1,325 diploid <jats:italic>Zea mays</jats:italic>, 314 triploid <jats:italic>Musa acuminata</jats:italic>, and 924 diploid <jats:italic>Manihot esculenta</jats:italic> samples genotyped with 955,690, 142,119, and 287,952 genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) markers, respectively.</jats:p>",

Typical experiments and breeding nurseries can contain thousands of unique entries and programs will often evaluate tens of thousands of plots each year. To function efficiently on this scale, electronic data management becomes essential. Many research programs, however, continue to operate by scribing and transcribing massive amounts of data on paper field books. While effective, this form of data management places heavy burdens on human resources, decreases data integrity, and greatly limits future utilization of data and the ability to expand the breeding program. To help address these constraints, we have developed an open‐source application for electronic data capture that runs on consumer‐grade Android tablets. By focusing on a simple, stand‐alone application with an intuitive and customized interface, we attempt to decrease both the technological and cost barriers that hinder adoption of electronic data management in breeding programs. The simplicity of Field Book allows adoption of the technology without a steep learning curve. With low‐cost, accessible solutions, the vision of one handheld per breeder can become a reality for breeding programs around the world. Transformational capacity in electronic data collection and management will be essential to realizing a contemporary green revolution.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Conservation and exploitation of crop wild relative species is an important component in ensuring food security and improving current agricultural output. By identifying agriculturally important characteristics that express favorable response to both biotic and abiotic stress currently unused by breeders, the incorporation of this new genetic material into genetic background stocks may help mitigate problems imposed by climate change, land degradation, and population pressure. This is particularly important in countries that will be more severely affected by the threat of reduced yields. The ability to effectively manage genetic resources collections and integrate unique and diverse data types is crucial in exploring, understanding, and exploiting the diversity contained within genebanks. Providing a common interface through which experimental and background data can be disseminated to both researchers and breeders will bring focus and facilitate community building into research communities. We have taken wild barley (<jats:italic>Hordeum</jats:italic> spp.) and potato (<jats:italic>Solanum</jats:italic> spp.) collections along with wheat (<jats:italic>Triticum</jats:italic> spp.) and maize (<jats:italic>Zea mays</jats:italic> subsp. <jats:italic>mays</jats:italic>) and their wild relatives and incorporated this data into web‐based information resources built using the Germinate platform (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"https://ics.hutton.ac.uk/get-germinate\">https://ics.hutton.ac.uk/get‐germinate</jats:ext-link>, accessed 4 Apr. 2017). We have tailored these to better meet the demands of researchers by developing both new data visualization tools and integration with current software such as Helium, Flapjack, and CurlyWhirly (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"https://ics.hutton.ac.uk/software\">https://ics.hutton.ac.uk/software</jats:ext-link>, accessed 4 Apr. 2017) and presented the data in a common platform. While the underlying species differ, the approach taken ensures that tools are compatible across all database instances. We will describe these database instances and show that Germinate offers a common platform that will aid in the exploration and wider use of these species.</jats:p>",

More than 7 million plant germplasm accessions are currently conserved in 1750 genebanks worldwide, and about two million accessions are estimated to be unique. The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture was established to conserve and utilize these plant genetic resources. However, long‐term conservation of such a large volume of diverse germplasm remains a challenging mission. Many critical issues affecting genebank sustainability have emerged. Of note are the vulnerability of genebanks and the risk of within‐genebank genetic erosion through genetic drift and viability selection. Here, we review the overall conservation efforts over the last 50 yr, analyze the critical issues in genebanks, and identify the elements that threaten long‐term germplasm conservation. Measures are explored with the hope to mitigate variable threats for genebank sustainability and to secure a food supply for humanity for generations to come.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "As the world moves forward into an uncertain future our agro-ecosystems will come under increasing pressure, threatening our food security. In fact, climate change, dwindling water supplies, rising energy costs, the emergence of new pests and diseases, loss of arable land and population growth mean that our crop plants will need to yield more on less land, with fewer inputs under increasingly harsh conditions. For this reason, plant breeders will be forced to mine global plant genetic resources collections for variation that can be used to future-proof our crop plants. However, the genetic resources collections are large and we cannot afford to evaluate every accession in a collection as we hunt for desirable traits. The Focused Identification of Germplasm Strategy (FIGS) was developed to help unlock the variation in genebanks and make it more accessible to the plant breeding community. This paper explains how FIGS works and gives examples of how rare traits have been uncovered by using the technology.",

These challenges have led to the development of Mr.Bean, an accessible and user-friendly tool with a comprehensive graphical visualization interface. The application integrates descriptive analysis, measures of dispersion and centralization, linear mixed model fitting, multi-environment trial analysis, factor analytic models, and genomic analysis.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the last century, breeding programs have traditionally favoured yield-related traits, grown under high-input conditions, resulting in a loss of genetic diversity and an increased susceptibility to stresses in crops. Thus, exploiting understudied genetic resources, that potentially harbour tolerance genes, is vital for sustainable agriculture. Northern European barley germplasm has been relatively understudied despite its key role within the malting industry. The European Heritage Barley collection (ExHIBiT) was assembled to explore the genetic diversity in European barley focusing on Northern European accessions and further address environmental pressures.  ExHIBiT consists of 363 spring-barley accessions, focusing on two-row type. The collection consists of landraces (~14%), old cultivars (~18%), elite cultivars (~67%) and accessions with unknown breeding history (~1%), with 70% of the collection from Northern Europe. The population structure of the ExHIBiT collection was subdivided into three main clusters primarily based on the accession’s year of release using 26,585 informative SNPs based on 50k iSelect single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data. Power analysis established a representative core collection of 230 genotypically and phenotypically diverse accessions. The effectiveness of this core collection for conducting statistical and association analysis was explored by undertaking genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using 24,876 SNPs for nine phenotypic traits, four of which were associated with SNPs. Genomic regions overlapping with previously characterised flowering genes (HvZTLb) were identified, demonstrating the utility of the ExHIBiT core collection for locating genetic regions that determine important traits. Overall, the ExHIBiT core collection represents the high level of untapped diversity within Northern European barley, providing a powerful resource for researchers and breeders to address future climate scenarios.</jats:p>",

During the middle of last century, triggered by the realization that genetic erosion was threatening the existing landraces and wild relatives of the major food crops, global efforts to collect and conserve the genetic diversity of these threatened resources were initiated, predominantly orchestrated by FAO. National and international genebanks were established to store and maintain germplasm materials, conservation methodologies were created, standards developed, and coordinating efforts were put in place to ensure effective and efficient approaches and collaboration. In the spontaneously developing global conservation system, plant breeders played an important role, aiming at the availability of genetic diversity in their breeding work. Furthermore, long-term conservation and the safety of the collected materials were the other two overriding criteria that led to the emerging international network of ex situ base collections. The political framework for the conservation of plant genetic resources finds its roots in the International Undertaking of the FAO and became ‘turbulent rapid’ with the conclusion of the Convention on Biological Diversity. This paper reviews the history of the global ex situ conservation system with a focus on the international network of base collections. It assesses the major ex situ conservation approaches and methods with their strengths and weaknesses with respect to the global conservation system and highlights the importance of combining in situ and ex situ conservation.</jats:p>",

Used by cotton researchers worldwide, and managed by experts with crop-specific knowledge, it continuous to be the logical choice to integrate new data and provide necessary interfaces for information retrieval. The repository in CottonGen contains colleague, gene, genome, genotype, germplasm, map, marker, metabolite, phenotype, publication, QTL, species, transcriptome, and trait data curated by the CottonGen team. The number of data entries housed in CottonGen has increased dramatically, for example, since 2014 there has been an 18-fold increase in genes/mRNAs, a 23-fold increase in whole genomes, and a 372-fold increase in genotype data. New tools include a genetic map viewer, a genome browser, a synteny viewer, a metabolite pathways browser, sequence retrieval, BLAST, and a breeding information management system (BIMS), as well as various search pages for new data types. CottonGen serves as the home to the International Cotton Genome Initiative, managing its elections and serving as a communication and coordination hub for the community.

    "abstract": "Plant phenomics data has been greatly facilitated those past ten years at several levels: data standards to organize and describe data, databases for the management of the experiments, data repositories to ensure long term accessibility supplemented by data portals to maximise findability and finally guidelines to ease their usage. We will review the recent advances from joint initiatives involving two European infrastructures: ELIXIR (Life science data) and EMPHASIS (Plant phenomics). First we will update the current status of MIAPPE (www.miappe.org), a data standard interoperable with the Breeding API that enables not only phenoytping experiment formalisation but also their linking with genotyping. We will also give an overview of its usage in generic data repositories such as Dataverse or Zenodo and their relation with experimental database such as PHIS. Finding the right documentation to use those tools and standard is not always straightforward. The RDMKit (https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/) is a guidelines portal that has been build to help researchers finding the information subset they need. Through dedicated section, such as the plant domain page (https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/), it shows the complementarity between standard and tools and provide the guidances needed for data management. Finally, we will also update the status of FAIDARE (https://urgi.versailles.inrae.fr/faidare/), a global data portal that indexes 30 databases using either BrAPI or a generic minimal format.",
